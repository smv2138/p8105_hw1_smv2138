This is my solution to HW1.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

### Part A

Create a data frame with the specified elements

``` r
prob1_df = 
tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high"))
)
```

### Part B

Take the mean of each variable in the data frame

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.01590417

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df,factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I can take the mean of numbers and logical but not characters or
factors.

For “samp\_gt\_0”, R is converting them to 0 and 1 before taking the
mean.

### Part C

Converting all variables to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
mean(as.numeric(pull(prob1_df,factor_vec)))
```

The “as.numeric” function makes it clear that R converts logicals to 0
and 1. Now, I am able to take the mean of the factor\_vec (after it was
converted to a numeric).

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

I was able to convert the logical to a numeric and then multiply the
result to the sample. I was not able to multiply the converted factor by
the sample. However, once I converted the factor back to a numeric, I
was able to successfully multiply the result by the sample.

## Problem 2

### Part A

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

mean(as.numeric(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm)), na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

There are 344 observations (rows) and 8 columns in the penguins dataset.
One key variables include the type pf species (factor), which consists
of 3 levels (Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo). The “island” variable was
also a factor with 3 levels as well (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen). Bill
length (mm) and bill depth (mm) were both numeric variables with some
missing data (NA). Flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) were both
integers and also had missing NA values. Sex was a factor variable with
2 levels (and also had missing NA values). Year was the last variable in
the dataset and was an integar.

To take the mean of flipper length, we need to specify to remove NA
values so we add “na.rm = TRUE” in the code line. This is an argument of
the mean function, so the brackets were placed appropriately.

The flipper length mean was 200.9152 mm.

### Part B

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Created a scatter plot of bill length (mm) by flipper length (mm) and
categorized them by species type.
